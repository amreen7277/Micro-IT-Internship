# 🧠 Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm

This project is submitted as part of the **Microsoft AICTE Virtual Internship (AI Track)**. It demonstrates how AI decision-making can be applied to a game using the **Minimax algorithm** to create an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe bot.

## 🎯 Objective

Build an AI agent that can:
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human
- Use the Minimax algorithm to choose optimal moves
- Ensure that it never loses

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- No external libraries required

## 🛠️ Run Instructions

### Command-line Version:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

### GUI Version:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe_gui.py
```

## 🎮 How It Works

The AI simulates all possible game outcomes using **Minimax**, assigns scores to each, and picks the move that leads to a win or draw. This ensures it always plays optimally.
